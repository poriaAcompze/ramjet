## What is the Plot of World War Z?
  
If you are curious about what happens in World War Z, here is a brief summary of the plot. However, be warned that there might be some spoilers ahead, so if you want to enjoy the movie without knowing the twists and turns, you might want to skip this section.
  
The movie begins with Gerry Lane, a former UN investigator, and his family getting stuck in a traffic jam in Philadelphia. They soon realize that something is terribly wrong, as people start attacking each other and turning into zombies. Gerry manages to get his family to safety and receives a call from his former boss, Thierry Umutoni, who offers him a place on a UN plane in exchange for his help in finding the source of the outbreak.
  
Gerry agrees and leaves his family on a US Navy ship while he joins a team of soldiers and scientists on a mission to South Korea, where the first case of infection was reported. There, he learns from a rogue CIA agent that Israel might have some clues, as they had built a wall around Jerusalem to protect themselves from the zombies.
  
Gerry flies to Israel and meets with Mossad chief Jurgen Warmbrunn, who explains that they had received a warning from an Indian army general about a "zombie plague". Gerry witnesses how Israel manages to keep the zombies out by using loud music and singing to drown out their noises. However, this also attracts more zombies, who eventually form a massive pile and breach the wall.
  
Gerry escapes with an Israeli soldier named Segen and contacts Thierry, who arranges for them to be picked up by a plane in Belarus. On the way, Gerry notices that some people are ignored by the zombies, as if they are invisible. He deduces that they might have some terminal illness or condition that makes them undesirable to the zombies.
  
Gerry and Segen board the plane, but it is soon overrun by zombies who had stowed away in the cargo. Gerry manages to detonate a grenade and blow out a part of the plane, killing most of the zombies and forcing the plane to crash-land in Wales. Gerry survives with a serious injury, but Segen saves him and they make their way to a nearby World Health Organization (WHO) facility.
  
There, Gerry meets with some doctors who are working on finding a cure or a vaccine for the zombie virus. He tells them his theory that injecting himself with a deadly but curable pathogen might make him invisible to the zombies. He decides to test his theory by going into a zombie-infested wing of the facility where some samples of pathogens are stored.
  
He manages to reach the samples and inject himself with one of them, hoping that it is not lethal. He then walks past several zombies who ignore him, confirming his theory. He returns to the doctors who treat him and contact his family and Thierry.
  
The movie ends with Gerry reuniting with his family on a safe zone in Nova Scotia, while a voice-over narrates that the war against the zombies is not over, but humanity has found a way to fight back.
